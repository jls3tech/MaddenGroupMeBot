MaddenGroupMeBot
This is code is a bot that services a Madden franchise league I am a member of. We use groupme and DaddyLeagues to manage and communicate. To make this bot a reality, I am leveraging cloud native Azure tools: (1) Logic Apps and (1) storage account (hosting a table and a blob container). The group is very active and so far, the Azure cost is less that 8 cents a day. 

The code adds the follow features to a bot:

#Tradeblock

@h3dbot rmtrb bal boller

#Team Page

#Power rankings

Future iterations will include:

#Schedule
#Stats
